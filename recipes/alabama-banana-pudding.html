    <h1>Alabama Banana Pudding</h1>
    <p>Layers of silken custard, sliced bananas, and some manner of vanilla baked good come together to form a dessert greater than the sum of its parts. Banana pudding is a sweet treat loved by many, its legion of fans often possessing very strong opinions about what exactly makes the dish so great. However one chooses to construct banana pudding — served hot or cold, layered with Nilla wafers or sponge cake, topped with whipped cream or meringue — the classic dessert is as American as apple pie.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark rum</li>
        <li>5 medium bananas, sliced</li>
        <li>1 12-ounce box vanilla wafers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt and egg yolks in a large saucepan. Whisk in milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring, until it thickens to a custard, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in butter, vanilla and rum. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Place ¹/₃ of the vanilla wafers over bottom of 8″ × 8″ dish. Top with ¹/₃ bananas, then cover bananas with ¹/₃ of the pudding. Repeat each layer twice.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until chilled. Serve cold with vanilla wafers on top.</li>
        </ol>
